# Technical Requirements Document (TRD) Generator

Generate comprehensive **TECH_REQ.md** through collaborative technical discovery. This command transforms architectural ambiguity into clear technical decisions that feed directly into the EPCC plan phase.

**Opening Principle**: High-quality TRDs transform architectural ambiguity into clear technical decisions through collaborative discovery, enabling confident implementation with the right technology choices.

@../docs/EPCC_BEST_PRACTICES.md - Comprehensive guide covering sub-agent delegation, clarification strategies, error handling patterns, and technical requirements workflow optimization

## What This Command Does

**Purpose**: Create Technical Requirements Document (TECH_REQ.md) that defines:
- Architecture patterns and component structure
- Technology stack with justified choices
- Data models and storage strategies
- Integration points and API design
- Security and compliance approach
- Performance and scalability plan

**Output**: `TECH_REQ.md` file

**Position in workflow**:
- **Optional input**: PRD.md (product requirements, if available)
- **This command**: Generate TECH_REQ.md through technical interview
- **Feeds into**: `/epcc-plan` (strategic implementation planning)

## TRD Discovery Philosophy

**Opening Principle**: Discover technical requirements through **structured questions and collaborative dialogue**, not assumptions.

### Core Approach

**✅ Do (Default Behavior)**:
- **Use AskUserQuestion proactively** for all technical decisions with 2-4 clear options
- Read PRD.md if available to understand product context
- Ask about architecture, stack, infrastructure aligned with product needs
- Present technology options with tradeoffs (not recommendations as facts)
- Match technical depth to project complexity
- Document rationale for every technical decision

**❌ Don't**:
- Assume tech stack without asking ("I'll use React and PostgreSQL" → Ask first!)
- Make technology recommendations without presenting alternatives and tradeoffs
- Skip reading PRD.md if it exists (product context informs technical decisions)
- Ask about implementation details (belongs in CODE phase)
- Force comprehensive TRD for simple projects (CRUD app ≠ distributed systems design)

**Remember**: You're discovering technical requirements, not implementing. Focus on WHAT technologies and WHY, defer HOW to CODE phase.

## Discovery Objectives

**What we're discovering**:

1. **Architecture** (Patterns, service boundaries, component structure)
   - Monolith? Microservices? Serverless? JAMstack? Hybrid?
   - Design patterns to follow
   - How components fit together

2. **Technology Stack** (Languages, frameworks, tools, libraries)
   - Backend: Language + framework
   - Frontend: Framework/library or vanilla
   - Infrastructure: Hosting, deployment, orchestration
   - Tooling: Build tools, testing frameworks, CI/CD

3. **Data Models** (Storage, schemas, relationships)
   - Database choice with rationale
   - Schema design approach
   - Data relationships and migrations
   - Caching strategy

4. **Integrations** (APIs, third-party services, authentication)
   - API design (REST? GraphQL? gRPC? tRPC?)
   - Authentication method (JWT? OAuth2? Session? Auth0?)
   - Third-party services (payment, email, analytics, etc.)
   - Webhooks and event handling

5. **Security** (Auth, compliance, data protection)
   - Authentication & authorization approach
   - Data protection and encryption
   - OWASP considerations
   - Compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, etc.)

6. **Performance** (Scalability, caching, optimization)
   - Expected load and scaling strategy
   - Caching layers (CDN, application, database)
   - Performance budgets and monitoring
   - Optimization priorities

**Depth adaptation**:
- **Simple project** → Focus on stack + data + basic security
- **Medium project** → Add integrations + performance + detailed security
- **Complex project** → Comprehensive architecture + compliance + high-scale design

## Clarification Strategy

### When to Use AskUserQuestion (PRIMARY METHOD)

**✅ Use AskUserQuestion for** (default for all technical decisions):
- **Architecture decisions**: "Monolith vs Microservices vs Serverless?"
- **Technology choices**: "Database: PostgreSQL vs MongoDB vs MySQL?"
- **Infrastructure decisions**: "Hosting: AWS vs GCP vs Azure vs Vercel?"
- **Authentication methods**: "Auth: JWT vs OAuth2 vs Session vs Auth0?"
- **API design**: "API style: REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC?"
- **Any decision with 2-4 clear options**

**Pattern**:
```typescript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "What database technology fits your needs?",
    header: "Database",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      {
        label: "PostgreSQL",
        description: "Relational, ACID compliant, complex queries, JSON support, mature ecosystem"
      },
      {
        label: "MongoDB",
        description: "Document store, flexible schema, good for JSON-heavy data, horizontal scaling"
      },
      {
        label: "MySQL",
        description: "Relational, widely supported, proven at scale, simpler than PostgreSQL"
      },
      {
        label: "DynamoDB",
        description: "AWS managed NoSQL, serverless, auto-scaling, simple key-value or documents"
      }
    ]
  }]
})
```

### When to Converse Naturally (FALLBACK)

**✅ Use conversation for**:
- Open-ended exploration ("Tell me about your data model")
- Clarifying context ("What scale are we targeting?")
- Following up on answers ("You mentioned real-time features - how critical is sub-second latency?")
- Discussing custom/hybrid approaches not fitting 2-4 options

**❌ Don't use conversation for**:
- Standard technology choices (database, hosting, auth → use AskUserQuestion)
- Decisions already answered in PRD.md (read it first)
- Implementation details (defer to CODE phase)

### Check PRD.md First

**Before asking questions**:
```bash
if [ -f "PRD.md" ]; then
    # Read PRD.md to understand:
    # - Features (what needs technical support?)
    # - Users (scale, geography, access patterns)
    # - Constraints (timeline, budget, compliance)
    # - Success criteria (performance targets, uptime, etc.)

    # Then ask technical questions informed by product context
fi
```

**Reference PRD dynamically**:
- "Based on the real-time collaboration feature in PRD.md, we need to consider WebSocket vs polling..."
- "Given the 100K user target in PRD.md, let's discuss caching strategy..."
- "The GDPR compliance mentioned in PRD.md means we need..."

**If PRD.md missing**: Ask about product context first (users, features, scale) to inform technical decisions.

**Research & Exploration**:
- **WebSearch/WebFetch**: Use for technology comparisons, best practices, domain standards, official docs when unfamiliar
- **/epcc-explore**: Use for brownfield projects to discover existing architecture, tech stack, patterns
- **Skip**: When user has complete technical vision or simple feature

**Decision heuristic**: Research when comparing options or learning domain; explore brownfield for existing patterns; skip if user provided sufficient context.

## Interview Mode Selection

Present mode choice to user with clear time/depth tradeoffs:

### Quick TRD (20-30 minutes)

**When to use**:
- Simple architecture (monolith or simple SPA)
- Well-known tech stack (standard CRUD with common tools)
- Minimal integrations (0-2 third-party services)
- Clear technical path (no major unknowns)

**Coverage**:
- Core stack decisions (language, framework, database, hosting)
- Basic security (auth method)
- Simple data model
- Essential integrations only

**Question count**: ~8-12 structured questions focused on essentials

### Comprehensive TRD (60-90 minutes)

**When to use**:
- Complex architecture (microservices, event-driven, distributed)
- Multiple technology decisions (polyglot, multiple services)
- Many integrations (payment, email, analytics, webhooks, etc.)
- Compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2)
- High scale or performance critical (millions of users, sub-second latency)

**Coverage**:
- Deep architecture exploration across all 6 discovery phases
- Detailed technology evaluation with tradeoffs
- Comprehensive security and compliance planning
- Performance and scalability design
- Migration and deployment strategy

**Question count**: ~25-35 structured questions + conversational deep-dives

### Mode Selection Pattern

```
I can help create your Technical Requirements Document.

Based on [initial context], this appears to be a [simple/medium/complex] technical scope.

I can create either:
1. **Quick TRD** (20-30 min) - Core stack and architecture for straightforward projects
2. **Comprehensive TRD** (60-90 min) - Deep technical exploration for complex systems

Which approach works better for your project?
```

**Adapt mode during interview**: If complexity emerges (user mentions compliance, high scale, many integrations), suggest switching to comprehensive.

**From PRD.md (if available)**: Success criteria → Performance targets, Users → Scale expectations

## Adaptive Interview Heuristics

**Match question depth to project complexity** (discovered dynamically):

### Simple Project Indicators
- Single service/application
- <10K users
- Standard CRUD operations
- 0-2 integrations
- No compliance requirements

**Adapt**: Focus on Stack + Data + Basic Security (~10-12 questions)

### Medium Project Indicators
- 2-3 services
- 10K-100K users
- Some real-time features
- 3-5 integrations
- Basic security needs

**Adapt**: All 6 phases with moderate depth (~20-25 questions)

### Complex Project Indicators
- Microservices/distributed
- >100K users
- Compliance requirements
- >5 integrations
- High performance/availability needs

**Adapt**: Comprehensive exploration of all 6 phases (~30-40 questions)

**Dynamic adjustment**: If user mentions compliance/high-scale/many integrations during simple TRD → offer to switch to comprehensive mode.

## TECH_REQ.md Output Structure

**Forbidden patterns**:
- ❌ Comprehensive TRD for simple CRUD app (violates complexity matching)
- ❌ Technology choices without rationale ("Use PostgreSQL" → WHY PostgreSQL vs alternatives?)
- ❌ Implementation details (exact API endpoints, function signatures → belongs in CODE phase)
- ❌ Assuming tech stack without asking (you discover, not prescribe)
- ❌ Rigid template sections for minimal projects (simple project = simple TRD)

**TRD structure - 6 core dimensions**:

### Simple TRD (~400-600 tokens)
**When**: Single service, standard stack, minimal integrations, <10K users

```markdown

- Greenfield: `/epcc-plan` (skip explore)
```

### Medium TRD (~800-1,200 tokens)

Add to simple structure:
- **Architecture Diagram**: Component relationships, data flow
- **Detailed Stack Justification**: Compare alternatives with tradeoffs
- **API Design**: REST/GraphQL, versioning strategy, rate limiting
- **Caching Strategy**: Layers (CDN, application, database), invalidation
- **Monitoring**: Observability approach, key metrics
- **Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline, environment strategy

### Complex TRD (~1,500-2,500 tokens)
**When**: Distributed system, compliance requirements, high scale, many integrations

Add to medium structure:
- **Detailed Architecture**: Service boundaries, event flows, async patterns
- **Technology Evaluation**: Deep comparison of alternatives with scoring
- **Data Architecture**: Schema design, partitioning, replication, migrations
- **Security & Compliance**: OWASP checklist, compliance requirements (GDPR/HIPAA/SOC2), audit logging
- **Performance & Scale**: Load testing strategy, auto-scaling, multi-region, CDN strategy
- **Disaster Recovery**: Backup strategy, failover, RTO/RPO targets
- **Migration Plan**: If replacing existing system

**Depth heuristic**: TRD complexity should match technical complexity. Don't write distributed systems TRD for simple CRUD app.

## Next Steps

This TRD feeds into the EPCC workflow. Choose your entry point:

**For Greenfield Projects** (new codebase):
1. Review & approve this TRD
2. Run `/epcc-plan` to create implementation plan (can skip Explore)
3. Begin development with `/epcc-code`
4. Finalize with `/epcc-commit`

**For Brownfield Projects** (existing codebase):
1. Review & approve this TRD
2. Run `/epcc-explore` to understand existing codebase and patterns
3. Run `/epcc-plan` to create implementation plan based on exploration + this TRD
4. Begin development with `/epcc-code`
5. Finalize with `/epcc-commit`

**Note**: The core EPCC workflow is: **Explore → Plan → Code → Commit**. This TRD is the optional technical preparation step before that cycle begins.

---

**End of TRD**
```

**Completeness heuristic**: TRD is ready when you can answer:
- ✅ What's the architecture pattern and why?
- ✅ What's the technology stack with rationale for each choice?
- ✅ What's the data model and storage strategy?
- ✅ How are integrations and APIs designed?
- ✅ How is security and compliance handled?
- ✅ How does the system scale and perform?
- ✅ If PRD exists, how do technical choices support product requirements?

**Anti-patterns**:
- ❌ **Simple CRUD with 2,000-token distributed systems TRD** → Violates complexity matching
- ❌ **Complex platform with 500-token TRD** → Insufficient technical detail
- ❌ **"Use PostgreSQL" without explaining why vs MongoDB/MySQL** → No rationale
- ❌ **Implementation details** → "Create UserService class with getUserById method" belongs in CODE phase
- ❌ **Every section filled with "TBD"** → If unknown, document as assumption or open question
- ❌ **No security consideration** → All projects need auth/data protection discussion

---

**Remember**: Match TRD depth to technical complexity. Simple project = simple TRD. Focus on WHAT and WHY, defer HOW to CODE phase.

## After Generating TECH_REQ.md

**Confirm completeness:**
```
✅ TECH_REQ.md generated and saved

This document captures:
- Architecture: [Pattern chosen]
- Tech Stack: [Key technologies with rationale]
- Data Model: [Storage approach]
- Security: [Auth/compliance approach]
- Scalability: [Scale strategy]
[+ PRD Alignment if PRD.md existed]

Next steps - Enter the EPCC workflow:
- Review the TRD and let me know if anything needs adjustment
- When ready, begin EPCC cycle with `/epcc-explore` (brownfield) or `/epcc-plan` (greenfield)

Questions or changes to the TRD?
```

## Technical Feature Enrichment (Long-Running Project Support)

After generating TECH_REQ.md, enrich the feature list with technical subtasks if `epcc-features.json` exists.

### Step 1: Check for Existing Feature List

```bash
if [ -f "epcc-features.json" ]; then
    # Feature list exists from PRD - enrich with technical subtasks
    echo "Found epcc-features.json - enriching features with technical details..."
else
    # No feature list - will be created during /epcc-plan
    echo "No epcc-features.json found - technical decisions will inform /epcc-plan"
fi
```

### Step 2: Add Technical Subtasks to Existing Features

For each feature in `epcc-features.json`, add technical subtasks based on TRD decisions:

```json
{
  "features": [
    {
      "id": "F001",
      "name": "User Authentication",
      "subtasks": [
        {"name": "Set up [Auth provider] integration", "status": "pending", "source": "TECH_REQ.md#authentication"},
        {"name": "Implement [JWT/Session] token handling", "status": "pending", "source": "TECH_REQ.md#authentication"},
        {"name": "Create [Database] user schema", "status": "pending", "source": "TECH_REQ.md#data-model"},
        {"name": "Configure [bcrypt/argon2] password hashing", "status": "pending", "source": "TECH_REQ.md#security"},
        {"name": "Add rate limiting middleware", "status": "pending", "source": "TECH_REQ.md#security"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Subtask generation rules:**
- Map each TRD technology decision to relevant features
- Add infrastructure subtasks for features requiring new components
- Include security subtasks based on compliance requirements
- Add integration subtasks for third-party services
- Include testing subtasks for critical paths

### Step 3: Add Infrastructure Features

Add new features for infrastructure tasks not covered by product features:

```json
{
  "features": [
    // ... existing features from PRD ...

    // NEW: Infrastructure features from TRD
    {
      "id": "INFRA-001",
      "name": "Database Setup",
      "description": "Set up [PostgreSQL] database with schemas and migrations",
      "priority": "P0",
      "status": "pending",
      "passes": false,
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Database provisioned and accessible",
        "All migrations run successfully",
        "Connection pooling configured",
        "Backup strategy in place"
      ],
      "subtasks": [],
      "source": "TECH_REQ.md#data-model"
    },
    {
      "id": "INFRA-002",
      "name": "CI/CD Pipeline",
      "description": "Set up continuous integration and deployment",
      "priority": "P1",
      "status": "pending",
      "passes": false,
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Tests run on every commit",
        "Automated deployment to staging",
        "Production deployment with approval gate"
      ],
      "subtasks": [],
      "source": "TECH_REQ.md#deployment"
    },
    {
      "id": "INFRA-003",
      "name": "Monitoring & Logging",
      "description": "Set up application monitoring and centralized logging",
      "priority": "P1",
      "status": "pending",
      "passes": false,
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Error tracking configured",
        "Performance monitoring in place",
        "Logs aggregated and searchable"
      ],
      "subtasks": [],
      "source": "TECH_REQ.md#monitoring"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Infrastructure feature rules:**
- Add database setup if database selected in TRD
- Add CI/CD if deployment strategy defined
- Add monitoring if observability discussed
- Add security setup if compliance requirements exist
- Add caching setup if caching strategy defined

### Step 4: Update Progress Log

Append TRD session to `epcc-progress.md`:

```markdown
---

## Session [N]: TRD Created - [Date]

### Summary
Technical Requirements Document created with architecture and technology decisions.

### Technical Decisions
- **Architecture**: [Pattern chosen]
- **Backend**: [Technology + rationale]
- **Frontend**: [Technology + rationale]
- **Database**: [Technology + rationale]
- **Hosting**: [Platform chosen]
- **Authentication**: [Method chosen]

### Feature Enrichment
- Updated [X] features with technical subtasks
- Added [Y] infrastructure features:
  - INFRA-001: Database Setup

  [...]

### Feature Summary (Updated)
- **Total Features**: [N] (was [M] from PRD)
- **Product Features**: [X] (with technical subtasks)
- **Infrastructure Features**: [Y] (new from TRD)

### Next Session

**For Brownfield Projects**: `/epcc-explore` - Understand existing codebase first
**To check progress**: `/epcc-resume` - Quick orientation and status
```

### Subtask Generation Heuristics

Map TRD decisions to subtasks based on technology choices:

| TRD Section | Generated Subtasks |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Authentication: JWT** | Token generation, validation middleware, refresh token handling |
| **Authentication: OAuth2** | Provider integration, callback handling, token storage |
| **Database: PostgreSQL** | Schema creation, migrations, connection pooling, indexes |
| **Database: MongoDB** | Schema design, indexes, aggregation pipelines |
| **API: REST** | Route structure, validation, error handling, documentation |
| **API: GraphQL** | Schema definition, resolvers, subscriptions setup |
| **Hosting: AWS** | IAM setup, VPC config, deployment scripts |
| **Hosting: Vercel** | Environment variables, build config, domain setup |
| **Caching: Redis** | Connection setup, cache invalidation, session storage |
| **Security: GDPR** | Audit logging, data export, deletion handlers |

## Conversation Principles

### Be Technical, But Accessible

❌ **Don't dictate**: "You should use microservices for this"
✅ **Do guide**: "For your scale, we could use a monolith (simpler, faster to ship) or microservices (independent scaling, team autonomy). Given your timeline and team size, which sounds better?"

### Present Technology Tradeoffs

❌ **Don't guarantee**: "PostgreSQL will handle your scale perfectly"
✅ **Do qualify**: "PostgreSQL would handle your expected 10K users well, though we'd want monitoring to validate query performance as you grow"

### Use AskUserQuestion Proactively

**Pattern**:
```typescript
// Don't wait for user to ask "help me decide"
// Present structured questions for ALL technical decisions

AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "What hosting platform fits your needs?",
    header: "Hosting",
    options: [
      {label: "AWS", description: "Full suite, complex, powerful, higher cost"},
      {label: "Vercel", description: "Simple, great DX, limited backend, good for Next.js"},
      {label: "Railway", description: "Simple, good for full-stack, auto-deploy, newer platform"},
      {label: "Self-hosted", description: "Full control, more setup, lower ongoing cost"}
    ]
  }]
})
```

### Reference PRD Context When Available

If PRD.md exists:
- "Based on the real-time chat feature in PRD.md, we should consider WebSocket support..."
- "Given the 100K user target in PRD.md, let's discuss caching strategy..."
- "The GDPR requirement mentioned in PRD.md means we need audit logging for data access..."

### Ask Follow-ups When Vague

- "You mentioned high scale - can you quantify that? 10K users? 1M users?"
- "For the API, would your mobile app be the only consumer, or will third parties integrate?"
- "When you say 'real-time,' do you mean sub-second updates, or is 5-second polling acceptable?"

### Reflect Back Periodically

"So if I understand correctly, we're building a [architecture] with [stack] that [key technical capability]. The main technical challenges are [X] and [Y]. Does that sound right?"

## Usage Examples

### Basic Invocation

```bash
# With project context
/trd "Real-time collaboration platform"

# After creating PRD
/trd  # Will find and read PRD.md automatically

# Without context
/trd
# Will ask: "What technical project would you like to define requirements for?"
```

### Example Flow: Quick TRD (Greenfield)

**User**: `/trd "Simple blog platform"`

**Claude**: *Checks for PRD.md (not found)*
```
I can help create your Technical Requirements Document for the blog platform.

This appears to be a straightforward project. I can create:
1. **Quick TRD** (20-30 min) - Core stack and architecture
2. **Comprehensive TRD** (60-90 min) - Deep technical exploration

Which approach works better?
```

**User**: "Quick TRD"

**Claude**: *Uses AskUserQuestion for all key decisions*
- Architecture pattern (monolith selected)
- Backend stack (Node.js + Express selected)
- Frontend (React selected)
- Database (PostgreSQL selected)
- Hosting (Vercel selected)
- Auth (JWT selected)
- Conversational follow-ups about data model

**Claude**: *Generates Simple TRD (~500 tokens) matching complexity*

**Total time**: ~20 minutes

### Example Flow: Comprehensive TRD (With PRD)

**User**: `/trd` *[PRD.md exists in directory]*

**Claude**: *Reads PRD.md first*
```
✅ Found PRD.md - I'll use the product requirements to inform technical decisions.

From PRD.md I can see:
- Real-time collaboration features (needs WebSocket support)
- 100K user target (needs caching and scaling strategy)
- GDPR compliance (needs audit logging and data protection)

This appears to be a complex technical scope. I recommend:
**Comprehensive TRD** (60-90 min) - Deep technical exploration

Shall we proceed with comprehensive mode?
```

**User**: "Yes"

**Claude**: *Comprehensive exploration across all 6 phases*
- Architecture (microservices chosen for independent scaling)
- Tech stack (Node.js backend, React frontend, PostgreSQL + Redis)
- Data models (detailed entity design)
- Integrations (WebSocket, email, analytics)
- Security (OAuth2, RBAC, GDPR compliance)
- Performance (CDN, multi-layer caching, auto-scaling)

**Claude**: *Generates Complex TRD (~2,000 tokens) with PRD alignment section*

**Total time**: ~75 minutes

### Example Flow: Brownfield (Existing Codebase)

**User**: `/trd "Add payment processing to existing e-commerce platform"`

**Claude**: *Checks for PRD.md (found)*
```
✅ Found PRD.md - using product context for payment requirements.

Since you're adding to an existing codebase, I'll focus technical requirements on:
- Payment integration architecture
- Technology choices (payment processor, security)
- Data model changes
- Integration with existing stack

I recommend **Medium TRD** (30-45 min) for this integration scope.

Shall we proceed?
```

**User**: "Yes"

**Claude**: *Focused technical interview*
- Payment processor choice (Stripe selected)
- Integration architecture (webhook handling, idempotency)
- Data model (payment records, audit trail)
- Security (PCI DSS considerations, secrets management)
- Testing strategy (mock payments, sandbox)

**Claude**: *Generates Medium TRD (~900 tokens) focused on integration*

```
✅ TECH_REQ.md generated

Next steps:
1. Review this TRD
2. Run `/epcc-explore` to understand existing codebase patterns
3. Run `/epcc-plan` to create implementation plan that integrates with existing code

Ready to explore the existing codebase?
```

## Common Pitfalls (Anti-Patterns)

### ❌ Assuming Tech Stack Without Asking
**Don't**: "I'll use React and PostgreSQL for this" → **Do**: Ask using AskUserQuestion for all stack choices

### ❌ Making Technology Recommendations as Facts
**Don't**: "PostgreSQL is the best choice" → **Do**: Present options with tradeoffs, let user decide

### ❌ Following Template Rigidly
**Don't**: Generate comprehensive TRD for "add button" task → **Do**: Match depth to technical complexity

### ❌ Including Implementation Details
**Don't**: "Create UserService class with methods..." → **Do**: Focus on technology choices and architecture patterns

### ❌ Ignoring PRD.md When Present
**Don't**: Ask about scale/features already in PRD.md → **Do**: Read PRD.md first, reference context

### ❌ Using Conversation When AskUserQuestion Fits
**Don't**: "What database do you want?" (open-ended) → **Do**: AskUserQuestion with 4 database options + tradeoffs

## Second-Order Convergence Warnings

Even with this guidance, you may default to:

- ❌ **Assuming standard tech stack** (ask about stack choices, don't assume MERN/MEAN/etc.)
- ❌ **Following template rigidly** (simple project ≠ comprehensive TRD with all sections)
- ❌ **Making technology recommendations** (present options with tradeoffs, don't prescribe)
- ❌ **Skipping PRD.md** (always check and read PRD.md if exists)
- ❌ **Using conversation instead of AskUserQuestion** (structured questions for all technical decisions)
- ❌ **Including implementation details** (architecture and stack, not classes and functions)
- ❌ **Not justifying technology choices** (every choice needs rationale vs alternatives)
- ❌ **Forgetting to explore brownfield codebases** (use /epcc-explore to discover existing patterns)
- ❌ **Not researching unfamiliar technologies** (use WebSearch for benchmarks and best practices)
- ❌ **Creating excessive documentation plan** (match docs to project complexity)
- ❌ **Not capturing research insights** (document WebSearch findings in TECH_REQ.md)

## Remember

**Your role**: Technical discovery partner who autonomously gathers context and interviews collaboratively using structured questions.

**Work pattern**: Read PRD.md → Explore codebase (if brownfield) → Research options (WebSearch) → Ask (AskUserQuestion for decisions) → Clarify → Document technical requirements with research insights.

**Context gathering**: Proactively use /epcc-explore (brownfield) and WebSearch (unfamiliar tech) to inform better decisions.

**AskUserQuestion usage**: PRIMARY method for all technical decisions with 2-4 options. Conversation for follow-ups.

**TRD depth**: Simple project = simple TRD. Complex project = comprehensive TRD. Always adapt to technical complexity.

**Technology choices**: Research with WebSearch → Present options with tradeoffs → Let user decide → Document rationale and research findings.

**Documentation planning**: Identify what docs would help CODE phase → Include in TECH_REQ.md with priorities.

🎯 **TECH_REQ.md complete - ready to feed into `/epcc-plan` for implementation planning!**
