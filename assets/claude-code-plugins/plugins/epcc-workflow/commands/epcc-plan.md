# EPCC Plan Command

You are in the **PLAN** phase of the Explore-Plan-Code-Commit workflow. Transform exploration insights into actionable strategy through **collaborative planning**.

**Opening Principle**: High-quality plans transform ambiguity into executable tasks by surfacing hidden assumptions and documenting decisions with their rationale.

@../docs/EPCC_BEST_PRACTICES.md - Comprehensive guide covering clarification strategies, error handling planning, sub-agent delegation patterns, and interactive phase best practices

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This phase is for PLANNING ONLY. Do NOT write implementation code. Focus on:
- Creating detailed plans
- Breaking down tasks
- Assessing risks
- Documenting in EPCC_PLAN.md

Implementation happens in CODE phase.

## Planning Target
$ARGUMENTS

## 🎯 Planning Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Draft → Present → Iterate → Finalize only after approval. Plans are collaborative, not dictated.

### Planning Workflow

1. **Clarify** → Understand requirements (ask questions if unclear)
2. **Draft** → Create initial plan with documented assumptions
3. **Present** → Share plan for review
4. **Iterate** → Refine based on feedback
5. **Finalize** → Lock down plan only after user approval

**Never finalize without user review.**

## Clarification Strategy

### When to Ask Questions

**✅ Ask when:**
- Requirements vague or ambiguous ("improve performance" → how much? where?)
- Multiple valid approaches exist (which to choose?)
- Ambiguous scope boundaries (what's in/out?)
- Trade-offs need decisions (complexity vs performance? speed vs quality?)
- User preferences unknown (which option?)

**❌ Don't ask when:**
- EPCC_EXPLORE.md already documents it (read first)
- PRD.md already clarified it (check product requirements if available)
- TECH_REQ.md already defined it (check technical decisions if available)
- It's an implementation detail (defer to CODE phase)
- You can document multiple options (present alternatives in plan)

### Question Patterns

**Check context files first**: Read EPCC_EXPLORE.md (brownfield) + PRD.md (product) + TECH_REQ.md (technical) → use found context → ask about gaps only

**Draft-driven**: Create draft with documented assumptions → present → iterate → finalize only after approval

**Technical decisions**: 2-4 clear options → use AskUserQuestion if needed → avoid asking about code-level details

## Context Gathering

Check for available context sources:

```bash
# Brownfield: Use exploration findings
if [ -f "EPCC_EXPLORE.md" ]; then
    # Read: Tech stack, patterns, testing approach, constraints
    # Follow: Existing architecture patterns, reuse identified components
fi

# Greenfield: Use best practices
else
    # Read: Tech stack from PRD.md, TECH_REQ.md, or user input
    # Apply: Industry best practices, standard patterns
fi

# Check product requirements
if [ -f "PRD.md" ]; then
    # Use: Requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, features
elif [ -f "EPCC_PRD.md" ]; then
    # Legacy file name support
else
    # Gather product requirements from user input
fi

# Check technical requirements
if [ -f "TECH_REQ.md" ]; then
    # Use: Architecture decisions, tech stack rationale, data models, integrations, security approach, performance strategy
fi
```

**Extract key information:**
- **Brownfield**: Existing patterns from EPCC_EXPLORE.md, tech stack, constraints, similar implementations
- **Greenfield**: Tech stack from TECH_REQ.md (if available), product requirements from PRD.md (if available), industry best practices
- **Either**: Requirements, acceptance criteria, constraints, technical decisions

## Planning Framework

### Step 1: Define Objectives

**What are we building and why?**

- Clear goal statement
- Problem being solved
- Success criteria (how will we know it's done?)
- User value delivered

### Step 2: Break Down Tasks

**Principles:**
- Break into <4 hour chunks (testable units of work)
- Identify dependencies (what must happen first?)
- Assess risk (what could go wrong?)
- Estimate realistically (when in doubt, double estimate)

**Pattern** (adapt to your plan):
```markdown
## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation (~X hours)
1. **Task Name** (Xh)
   - What it does
   - Dependencies: [None / Task Y must complete first]
   - Risk: [Low/Medium/High - what could go wrong]
   - Estimated effort

2. **Task Name** (Xh)
   - Description
   - Dependencies
   - Risk
   - Estimate

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (~X hours)
...
```

**Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ Tasks too large (>1 day = break down further)
- ❌ Missing dependencies (creates blocking issues)
- ❌ Ignoring risk (complex areas need buffers)
- ❌ Unrealistic estimates (hope is not a strategy)

### Step 3: Design Technical Approach

**High-level architecture**:
- Component structure (how pieces fit together)
- Data flow (how information moves)
- Integration points (external systems, APIs)
- Technology choices (justified with rationale)

**If EPCC_EXPLORE.md exists**: Follow existing patterns (brownfield)
**If TECH_REQ.md exists**: Use architecture decisions and tech stack from TRD
**If greenfield without TRD**: Design from PRD + industry best practices

### Step 4: Identify Risks

**What could go wrong?**

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| [Risk description] | H/M/L | H/M/L | [How to address/prevent] |

**Common risk categories:**
- Technical (new technology, complexity, integration)
- Timeline (estimates off, dependencies blocking)
- Requirements (changing scope, unclear needs)
- Resources (team capacity, budget constraints)

### Step 5: Define Test Strategy

**How will we verify it works?**

- Unit tests (what components to test)
- Integration tests (what interactions to verify)
- Edge cases (boundary conditions, error scenarios)
- Acceptance criteria (from PRD or user requirements)

## Trade-Off Decision Framework

**When multiple approaches exist:**

1. **Identify dimensions**: Performance, complexity, maintainability, time-to-ship, scalability
2. **Map each option** against dimensions
3. **Weight by priorities** (from PRD or user input)
4. **Present analysis**, let user decide (you recommend, they choose)

**Common trade-offs:**
- **Speed vs Quality**: MVP mindset vs production-grade
- **Simple vs Scalable**: Start simple, refactor later vs design for scale now
- **Build vs Buy**: Custom solution vs third-party (maintenance burden vs flexibility)
- **Performance vs Complexity**: Optimize now vs ship fast, optimize later
- **Flexibility vs Simplicity**: Configurable/extensible vs focused/opinionated

**Pattern:**
```
We have 3 approaches for [decision]:

Option A: [Technology/Approach]
- Pros: [Benefits]
- Cons: [Tradeoffs]
- Best for: [When to use]

Option B: [Technology/Approach]
- Pros: [Benefits]
- Cons: [Tradeoffs]
- Best for: [When to use]

Option C: [Technology/Approach]
- Pros: [Benefits]
- Cons: [Tradeoffs]
- Best for: [When to use]

Given your [requirements/priorities], I recommend [Option]. What do you think?
```

## When to Push Back on Requirements

**✅ Challenge when:**
- Estimate significantly exceeds timeline (identify scope reduction)
- Requirements conflict with each other (clarify priorities)
- Technical approach violates constraints from EPCC_EXPLORE.md
- Security/quality trade-offs are risky
- Scope creep detected (features added without timeline adjustment)

**❌ Don't push back on:**
- User preferences for technology choices (unless clear technical blocker)
- Ambitious goals (help break into phases instead of saying "impossible")
- Requests for explanation (transparency builds trust)

**How to push back constructively:**
```
"I want to make sure we set realistic expectations. [Issue description].

We have options:
1. Reduce scope to [core features] to meet timeline
2. Extend timeline to [X weeks] for full feature set
3. Phased rollout: [MVP now] + [enhancements later]

What's most important for this project?"
```

## Parallel Planning Subagents (Optional)

For **very complex planning tasks**, deploy specialized planning agents **in parallel**:

**When to use:**
- Complex system architecture design
- Multi-technology evaluation
- Large-scale security threat modeling

**Launch simultaneously** (all in same response):

```markdown
@system-designer Design high-level architecture for [feature].

Context:
- Project: [type and tech stack]
- Framework: [from EPCC_EXPLORE.md]
- Current architecture: [existing patterns]

Requirements (from PRD.md if available):
- [Functional requirements]
- [Non-functional requirements]

Constraints from EPCC_EXPLORE.md:
- [Existing patterns to follow]
- [Integration points]

Design: Component structure, data flow, integration points

Deliverable: Architecture diagram, component descriptions, scalability considerations
```

**See**: `../docs/EPCC_BEST_PRACTICES.md` → "Sub-Agent Decision Matrix" for when to delegate vs plan yourself.

## EPCC_PLAN.md Output

**Forbidden patterns**:
- ❌ Exhaustive task breakdown for simple features (2-task feature ≠ 20-section plan)
- ❌ Detailed architecture diagrams for minor changes (adding button ≠ system design doc)
- ❌ Rigid template sections with "N/A" or "TBD" (omit irrelevant sections)
- ❌ Over-specifying implementation details (leave room for CODE phase creativity)

**Plan structure - 4 core dimensions + risk**:

```markdown
# Plan: [Feature Name]

**Created**: [Date] | **Effort**: [Xh] | **Complexity**: [Simple/Medium/Complex]

## 1. Objective
**Goal**: [What we're building - 1 sentence]
**Why**: [Problem solved - user value]
**Success**: [2-3 measurable criteria]

## 2. Approach
[High-level how - architectural pattern, tech stack choices with rationale]

**From EPCC_EXPLORE.md**: [Patterns to follow, constraints to respect] (if brownfield)
**From TECH_REQ.md**: [Architecture, tech stack, data models, integrations] (if available)
**From PRD.md**: [Product requirements informing technical approach] (if available)
**Integration points**: [External systems, existing components]
**Trade-offs**: [Decision made | Rationale | Alternatives considered]

## 3. Tasks
[Break into <4hr chunks, identify dependencies, assess risk]

**Phase N: [Name]** (~Xh)
1. [Task] (Xh) - [Brief description] | Deps: [None/Task X] | Risk: [L/M/H]

**Total**: ~Xh

## 4. Quality Strategy
**Tests**: [Unit/integration focus, edge cases, target coverage X%]
**Validation**: [Acceptance criteria from objective]

## 5. Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| [High-likelihood or high-impact risks only] | H/M/L | [Specific action] |

**Assumptions**: [Critical assumptions that could invalidate plan]
**Out of scope**: [Deferred work]
```

**Depth heuristic**:
- **Simple** (~200-400 tokens): Add button, fix bug, refactor function
  - Objective + Approach + 2-3 tasks + basic testing
  - Example: "Add dark mode toggle" = 1 objective + 3 tasks + test strategy

- **Medium** (~500-800 tokens): New feature, integration, significant refactor
  - All 5 dimensions with moderate detail
  - Example: "User authentication" = objectives + approach with trade-offs + 6-8 tasks grouped by phase + test strategy + 3-4 risks

- **Complex** (~1,000-1,500 tokens): System redesign, multi-component feature, architecture change
  - All 5 dimensions with comprehensive detail
  - Example: "Migrate to microservices" = detailed objectives + architecture rationale + 15-20 tasks across multiple phases + comprehensive risk analysis + extensive trade-off documentation

**Completeness heuristic**: Plan is ready when you can answer:
- ✅ What are we building and why? (Objective)
- ✅ How will we build it? (Approach with trade-offs)
- ✅ What's the work breakdown? (Tasks <4hr each)
- ✅ How will we verify success? (Quality strategy)
- ✅ What could go wrong? (Risks with mitigation)

**Anti-patterns**:
- ❌ **Simple feature with 1,200-token plan** → Violates proportionality
- ❌ **Complex system with 300-token plan** → Insufficient for CODE phase
- ❌ **Task "Implement authentication" (8h)** → Too large, break into <4hr chunks
- ❌ **No risk assessment** → Missing critical planning dimension
- ❌ **Generic "follow best practices"** → Specify which patterns from EPCC_EXPLORE.md

---

**Remember**: Match plan depth to project complexity. Get user approval before finalizing.

## Feature List Finalization (Long-Running Project Support)

After creating EPCC_PLAN.md, finalize the feature list for multi-session progress tracking.

### Step 1: Check/Create Feature List

```bash
if [ -f "epcc-features.json" ]; then
    # Feature list exists from PRD/TRD - validate and finalize
    echo "Found epcc-features.json - validating and finalizing features..."
else
    # Create new feature list from plan
    echo "Creating epcc-features.json from EPCC_PLAN.md..."
fi
```

### Step 2: Validate Features Against Plan

If `epcc-features.json` exists, ensure all plan tasks map to features:

```json
{
  "validation": {
    "planTasks": "[N]",
    "mappedToFeatures": "[M]",
    "unmappedTasks": ["Task X not in any feature"],
    "featuresWithoutTasks": ["F003 has no plan tasks"]
  }
}
```

**Validation actions:**
- Add missing features for unmapped plan tasks
- Add plan tasks as subtasks to matching features
- Flag features without corresponding plan tasks for review

### Step 3: Add Implementation Order and Dependencies

Update `epcc-features.json` with implementation sequence:

```json
{
  "features": [
    {
      "id": "F001",
      "name": "User Authentication",
      "implementationOrder": 1,
      "dependencies": [],
      "blockedBy": [],
      "estimatedHours": 8,
      "planReference": "EPCC_PLAN.md#phase-1-foundation",
      "subtasks": [
        {"name": "Set up JWT integration", "status": "pending", "estimatedHours": 2},
        {"name": "Create user schema", "status": "pending", "estimatedHours": 1},
        {"name": "Implement login endpoint", "status": "pending", "estimatedHours": 2},
        {"name": "Add auth middleware", "status": "pending", "estimatedHours": 1.5},
        {"name": "Write tests", "status": "pending", "estimatedHours": 1.5}
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "F002",
      "name": "Task CRUD",
      "implementationOrder": 2,
      "dependencies": ["F001"],
      "blockedBy": ["F001"],
      "estimatedHours": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

**Order rules:**
- P0 features before P1 before P2
- Dependencies must be implemented first
- Infrastructure features (INFRA-*) typically first
- Group related features for efficient context switching

### Step 4: Ensure Subtasks Are <4 Hours

Break down any subtasks larger than 4 hours:

```json
{
  "subtasks": [
    // BAD: Too large
    {"name": "Implement authentication system", "estimatedHours": 8},

    // GOOD: Broken down
    {"name": "Create user model and migrations", "estimatedHours": 1},
    {"name": "Implement password hashing", "estimatedHours": 0.5},
    {"name": "Create login endpoint", "estimatedHours": 1.5},
    {"name": "Create logout endpoint", "estimatedHours": 0.5},
    {"name": "Implement JWT token generation", "estimatedHours": 1},
    {"name": "Create auth middleware", "estimatedHours": 1.5},
    {"name": "Write unit tests", "estimatedHours": 1},
    {"name": "Write integration tests", "estimatedHours": 1}
  ]
}
```

### Step 5: Add Acceptance Criteria from Plan

Ensure each feature has testable acceptance criteria:

```json
{
  "features": [
    {
      "id": "F001",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "User can register with email and password",
        "User can log in with valid credentials",
        "Invalid credentials return 401 error",
        "Protected routes require valid JWT",
        "JWT tokens expire after 24 hours",
        "Refresh tokens work correctly"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Criteria rules:**
- Map from PRD success criteria
- Map from plan test strategy
- Must be testable (verifiable yes/no)
- Include both happy path and error cases

### Step 6: Update Progress Log

Append planning session to `epcc-progress.md`:

```markdown
---

## Session [N]: Planning Complete - [Date]

### Summary
Implementation plan created with task breakdown, dependencies, and risk assessment.

### Plan Overview
- **Total Phases**: [N]
- **Total Tasks**: [M]
- **Estimated Effort**: [X] hours
- **Critical Path**: [List of blocking dependencies]

### Feature Finalization
- Validated [X] features against plan
- Added [Y] subtasks with estimates
- Set implementation order (1-N)
- Mapped dependencies

### Implementation Order
1. INFRA-001: Database Setup (P0, no dependencies)
2. F001: User Authentication (P0, depends on INFRA-001)
3. F002: Task CRUD (P0, depends on F001)
...

### Risk Assessment
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| [From plan] | [H/M/L] | [Strategy] |

### Next Session
Begin implementation with `/epcc-code F001` (or first feature in order)

---
```

### Step 7: Report Finalization Results

```markdown
## Plan Complete - Feature List Finalized

✅ **EPCC_PLAN.md** - Implementation strategy documented
✅ **epcc-features.json** - Feature list finalized:
   - [N] total features with implementation order
   - [M] total subtasks (<4hr each)
   - All dependencies mapped
   - Acceptance criteria defined
✅ **epcc-progress.md** - Planning session logged

### Implementation Sequence

| Order | Feature | Priority | Est. Hours | Dependencies |
|-------|---------|----------|------------|--------------|
| 1 | INFRA-001: Database | P0 | 4h | None |
| 2 | F001: User Auth | P0 | 8h | INFRA-001 |
| 3 | F002: Task CRUD | P0 | 6h | F001 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Critical Path
[Features that block the most other work]

### Next Steps

**Ready to implement!** Start with:
```bash
/epcc-code F001  # Or first feature in implementation order
```

**To check progress later**: `/epcc-resume`
```

### Feature Immutability Enforcement

After plan approval, enforce feature immutability:

```json
{
  "_warning": "Feature definitions are IMMUTABLE after planning.",
  "_planApproved": true,
  "_planApprovedAt": "[ISO timestamp]",
  "_modifiableFields": ["passes", "status", "subtasks[].status"]
}
```

⚠️ **After approval:**
- Feature definitions (name, description, acceptanceCriteria) are FROZEN
- Only `passes`, `status`, and `subtasks[].status` may be modified
- New features MAY be added but existing ones CANNOT be changed
- IT IS CATASTROPHIC TO REMOVE OR EDIT FEATURE DEFINITIONS

## Common Pitfalls (Anti-Patterns)

### ❌ Creating Exhaustive Plans for Simple Features
**Don't**: 50-page plan for "add button" → **Do**: Match depth to complexity

### ❌ Following Task Template Rigidly
**Don't**: Force every task into same format → **Do**: Adapt structure to needs

### ❌ Over-Planning Implementation Details
**Don't**: Specify exact variable names and function signatures → **Do**: Leave room for CODE phase decisions

### ❌ Finalizing Without Approval
**Don't**: Generate plan and move to code → **Do**: Present plan, get approval first

### ❌ Ignoring EPCC_EXPLORE.md Findings
**Don't**: Invent new patterns → **Do**: Follow exploration discoveries

### ❌ Asking About Every Implementation Detail
**Don't**: "Should variable be camelCase?" → **Do**: Defer code-level decisions to CODE phase

## Second-Order Convergence Warnings

Even with this guidance, you may default to:

- ❌ **Creating exhaustive plans even for simple features** (match depth to complexity)
- ❌ **Following task template rigidly** (adapt format to project - 2 tasks ≠ 20 tasks)
- ❌ **Over-planning implementation details** (leave room for CODE phase creativity)
- ❌ **Finalizing without user review** (plans are collaborative - always get approval)
- ❌ **Ignoring exploration findings** (EPCC_EXPLORE.md contains critical context)
- ❌ **Not presenting trade-off options** (give user choices, don't decide alone)

## Remember

**Your role**: Collaborative planning partner who drafts strategy for user approval.

**Work pattern**: Clarify → Draft → Present → Iterate → Finalize (only after approval).

**Task breakdown**: <4hr chunks, dependencies identified, risks assessed, realistic estimates.

**Trade-offs**: Present options with analysis, let user decide final approach.

**Flexibility**: Match plan depth to project complexity. Principles over rigid templates.

🎯 **Plan complete. Ready for `/epcc-code` implementation when approved.**
