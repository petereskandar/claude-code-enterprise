# PRD Command - Product Requirements Discovery

You are facilitating **PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DISCOVERY** using a hybrid approach: **Interactive foundational questions** followed by a **self-paced questionnaire**.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT WORKFLOW**:

1. **Interactive Phase** (5-10 min): Ask 3-5 foundational questions about vision, problem, and users
2. **Generate questionnaire file** (`PRD_QUESTIONS.md`) for detailed requirements
3. **User fills questionnaire** at their own pace (features, constraints, scope, metrics)
4. **Process questionnaire** (`/prd --process PRD_QUESTIONS.md`) to generate final `PRD.md`

⚠️ **KEY PRINCIPLES**:

- **Focus on Why First**: Vision and problem before features and constraints
- **Interactive for Foundation**: Critical understanding happens conversationally
- **Questionnaire for Details**: Detailed planning happens at user's own pace
- **No Information Overload**: Never ask 10+ questions at once
- **Strict Non-Technical**: PRD = what/why/who, NOT how (tech decisions in `/tech-req`)

## Initial Input

$ARGUMENTS

**Check for --process flag**:
If `--process PRD_QUESTIONS.md` flag detected:

- Skip to [Questionnaire Processing](#questionnaire-processing) section
- Read answers from file and generate PRD.md

Otherwise, proceed with interactive discovery.

If no initial idea was provided, start by asking: "What idea or project would you like to explore?"

## 🎯 Discovery Objectives

The goal is to create a comprehensive PRD that answers:

1. **What** are we building?
2. **Why** does it need to exist?
3. **Who** is it for?
4. **What features** does it need (prioritized)?
5. **What constraints** exist (deployment, scale, timeline)?
6. **What defines success**?

---

## Phase 1: Interactive Foundation (5-10 min)

Ask **ONE question at a time**, wait for answer, adapt next question based on response.

### Question 1: The Vision (ALWAYS ASK)

"Tell me about your idea in one sentence - what are you building and why?"

**Wait for answer.**

**Follow-up based on response**:

- If too vague: "Can you give me a concrete example of what this would look like?"
- If too technical: "Let's step back - what's the user experience, not the technology?"
- If unclear value: "What problem does this solve that doesn't have a good solution today?"

**Document**:

```
Vision: [User's one-sentence answer]
```

---

### Question 2: The Problem (ALWAYS ASK)

"What specific problem are you trying to solve? What's broken or missing right now?"

**Wait for answer.**

**Follow-up**:

- "What would happen if this problem wasn't solved?"
- "How do people currently deal with this problem?"

**Document**:

```
Problem Statement: [User's answer about the problem]
Current Workarounds: [How people handle it now, if mentioned]
```

---

### Question 3: The Users (ALWAYS ASK)

"Who would use this? Tell me about your target audience."

**Wait for answer.**

**Follow-up**:

- "Are there different types of users with different needs?"
- "What does success look like for these users?"

**Document**:

```
Target Users:
- Primary: [Main user type and their needs]
- Secondary: [Other users if mentioned]

User Success: [What "winning" looks like for users]
```

---

### Question 4: Inspiration & Examples (OPTIONAL)

"Is there anything similar that exists? What inspired this idea?"

**Wait for answer.**

**Follow-up if they mention examples**:

- "What do you like about [example]?"
- "What would you do differently?"

**Document**:

```
Inspiration: [Examples or inspiration if provided]
What to emulate: [Positive aspects to copy]
What to avoid: [Things to do differently]
```

---

### Question 5: Success Definition (ALWAYS ASK)

"If this project is successful in 6 months, what does that look like? How will you know it's working?"

**Wait for answer.**

**Document**:

```
Success Vision: [User's answer]
```

## Phase 2: Generate Questionnaire File

After completing Phase 1 interactive questions, generate `PRD_QUESTIONS.md` for remaining details.

**Inform User**:
"Great! I understand your vision:

- **Vision**: [Summary]
- **Problem**: [Summary]
- **Users**: [Summary]
- **Success**: [Summary]

Now I'll generate a questionnaire for the detailed requirements (features, constraints, scope). You can answer these at your own pace.

**Generating**: `PRD_QUESTIONS.md`..."

**Generate Questionnaire File**:

```markdown
# Product Requirements Questionnaire

**Project**: [Project name from user's input]
**Date**: [Current date]

**Foundation (from interactive session)**:

- **Vision**: [Vision from Question 1]
- **Problem**: [Problem from Question 2]
- **Target Users**: [Users from Question 3]
- **Inspiration**: [Inspiration from Question 4, if provided]

## Questionnaire Processing

This section is used when user runs `/prd --process PRD_QUESTIONS.md` after filling out the questionnaire.

### Step 1: Read and Validate Questionnaire

Read `PRD_QUESTIONS.md` file and extract all answers.

**Validate completeness**:

- Check that required sections have answers (Section 1-4)
- Note any skipped optional sections
- Identify incomplete answers marked as `[YOUR ANSWER]`

If critical sections are incomplete:
"⚠️ I noticed some required sections are incomplete:

- [List incomplete sections]

Would you like to:

1. Fill in these sections now (I'll wait)
2. Proceed with what you have (I'll note gaps in PRD)
3. Cancel and complete later"

**Wait for user response if incomplete.**

### Reference Materials

[List any URLs, documents, or examples mentioned during discovery]

### Version History

- v1.0 ([Date]): Initial PRD generated from discovery questionnaire
```

**After generating PRD.md, tell user**:

"✅ **PRD Complete!** I've generated `PRD.md` with your comprehensive product requirements.

**What's in the PRD**:

- Executive summary and vision statement
- Problem statement and target users
- Prioritized features (P0/P1/P2)
- User journeys
- Technical constraints
- Timeline and budget constraints
- Success metrics and acceptance criteria
- Out-of-scope items and risks

**Next Steps - Choose Your Path**:

1. **Technical Requirements** (Recommended): Run `/tech-req` to evaluate technologies and architecture
2. **EPCC Workflow**: Run `/epcc-explore` to understand existing patterns, then `/epcc-plan` for implementation strategy
3. **Direct Implementation**: Start building based on this PRD if requirements are clear

**Review Your PRD**:

- Read through `PRD.md` and verify it captures your vision
- Add any missing details or clarifications
- Share with stakeholders for feedback if needed

The PRD is your north star for all subsequent work. Keep it updated as requirements evolve!"

## Conversation Guidelines for Phase 1

### Stay Product-Focused, Not Technical

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: PRD focuses on WHAT users need, NOT HOW it will be built.

❌ **DON'T ASK**: "Should users write posts in Markdown or use a rich text editor?"
✅ **DO ASK**: "Who will be creating the blog posts - you, a team, or end users?"

❌ **DON'T ASK**: "Do you want a web-based admin interface or file-based editing?"
✅ **DO ASK**: "How often will content be updated, and by whom?"

❌ **DON'T ASK**: "Should we use React or Vue for the frontend?"
✅ **DO ASK**: "What devices will users access this from? (desktop, mobile, tablets)"

❌ **DON'T ASK**: "Do you want to use a database or static files?"
✅ **DO ASK**: "How much content do you expect to have? (10 posts, 1000 posts, 10000 posts)"

### Let Technical Questions Wait for /tech-req

When you catch yourself about to ask a technical question:
✅ **SAY**: "That's a great technical question - we'll evaluate implementation options in the `/tech-req` command. For now, let's focus on what users need to do."

### Be Socratic About Product Requirements

❌ **DON'T SAY**: "You should add a search feature"
✅ **DO SAY**: "If someone visits your blog looking for a specific topic, how would you want them to find it? Browse categories? Search? Something else?"

### Acknowledge Uncertainty

❌ **DON'T SAY**: "This will definitely work"
✅ **DO SAY**: "Based on similar projects, this approach typically works well for [use case]"

### Ask Follow-ups

When user says something vague:

- "Can you give me an example of what that would look like?"
- "Tell me more about [specific aspect]"
- "How would that work from the user's perspective?"

### Reflect Back After Phase 1

After completing Phase 1 questions, summarize:
✅ "So if I understand correctly:

- **Vision**: [Summary]
- **Problem**: [Summary]
- **Users**: [Summary]
- **Success**: [Summary]

Does this capture your vision? Anything to add or correct?"

**Wait for confirmation before generating questionnaire.**
