# Tech-Req Command - Technical Requirements Discovery

You are facilitating **TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS DISCOVERY** using a hybrid approach: **Interactive critical questions** followed by a **self-paced questionnaire**.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT WORKFLOW**:

1. **Read PRD context** (if exists) to extract constraints
2. **Ask 2-3 critical questions** interactively (architecture, cloud, framework category)
3. **Generate questionnaire file** (TECH_REQ_QUESTIONS.md) for remaining decisions
4. **User fills questionnaire** at their own pace
5. **Process questionnaire** (`/tech-req --process TECH_REQ_QUESTIONS.md`) to generate TECH_REQ.md

⚠️ **KEY PRINCIPLES**:

- **Smart Filtering**: Show only 2-3 most relevant options per decision (filtered by PRD constraints)
- **Sequential Decisions**: Later questions depend on earlier answers
- **No Information Overload**: Never present 4+ options simultaneously
- **Strict Separation**: PRD = what/why/who, Tech-Req = how/with what

## Initial Input

$ARGUMENTS

If `--process TECH_REQ_QUESTIONS.md` flag detected:

- Skip to [Questionnaire Processing](#questionnaire-processing) section
- Read answers from file and generate TECH_REQ.md

Otherwise, proceed with interactive discovery.

---

## Step 1: Extract PRD Context

If PRD.md exists, read it and extract:

- **Deployment Preference**: Cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP) / Local / Hybrid
- **Scale**: Expected users/traffic
- **Budget**: Infrastructure cost constraints
- **Team Technical Comfort**: Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced
- **Must Use/Avoid**: Required or forbidden technologies
- **Performance Requirements**: Response time targets
- **Data Needs**: Storage type and volume

**Document Extracted Constraints**:

```markdown
## PRD Constraints Extracted

- **Deployment**: [Cloud provider or preference]
- **Scale**: [User count, traffic estimates]
- **Budget**: [Monthly infrastructure budget]
- **Team Comfort**: [Technical skill level]
- **Must Use**: [Required technologies]
- **Must Avoid**: [Technologies to avoid]
- **Performance**: [Targets if specified]
- **Data**: [Storage needs]
```

If no PRD exists, ask user:
"I don't see a PRD.md file. Would you like me to:

1. Ask a few constraint questions now
2. Generate a PRD first using `/prd`
3. Proceed with general recommendations (no filtering)"

---

## Step 2: Interactive Critical Questions (2-3 questions only)

Ask **ONE question at a time**, wait for answer, adapt next question.

### Question 1: Architecture Pattern (ALWAYS ASK)

**Apply Smart Filtering** based on PRD constraints:

**Filtering Logic**:

- If "single author blog" or "documentation site" → Show only SSG + JAMstack (skip SSR, microservices)
- If "< 10 users" or "internal tool" → Show only Monolithic + Serverless (skip microservices)
- If "need real-time features" → Show SSR + Serverless (skip pure SSG)
- If "> 100 users" and "multiple teams" → Show Microservices + Hybrid
- **Default** (no constraints): Show Monolithic + Serverless + JAMstack (skip microservices unless scale justifies)

**Present Only 2-3 Filtered Options**:

"Based on your requirements [cite PRD constraints], here are the most suitable architecture patterns:

---

### Option 1: [Most Suitable Architecture for Constraints]

**What it is**: [One sentence description]

**Pros**:

- ✅ [Key advantage 1]
- ✅ [Key advantage 2]
- ✅ [Key advantage 3]

**Cons**:

- ❌ [Key limitation 1]
- ❌ [Key limitation 2]

**Best for**: [Specific use case]
**Matches your**: [How it aligns with PRD constraints]
**Cost**: [Monthly estimate]

---

### Option 2: [Second Most Suitable Architecture]

[Same structure as Option 1...]

---

[Optional Option 3 only if legitimately applicable]

---

**My Recommendation**: [Architecture] because [2-3 specific reasons tied to PRD constraints].

**Question**: Which architecture pattern aligns with your vision?"

**Wait for user answer before proceeding.**

---

### Question 2: Cloud Provider (CONDITIONAL)

**Only ask if**:

- PRD deployment preference is "Cloud"
- PRD didn't specify cloud provider preference

**Skip if**:

- PRD says "AWS only" → Auto-select AWS, document decision
- Deployment is Local/Hybrid → Skip to framework question

**Apply Smart Filtering**:

- If Budget < $10/month → Skip Azure/GCP, show AWS (best free tier)
- If "Must Use: Microsoft stack" → Show only Azure
- If no constraints → Show AWS + 1 alternative (GCP if focus is data/ML, Vercel if SSG architecture chosen)

**Present Only 2 Filtered Options**:

"For cloud hosting, here are your best options based on [architecture choice] and [budget/constraints]:

---

### Option 1: AWS

**Why for you**: [Specific reason based on architecture + constraints]
**Monthly Cost**: ~$[X] (for your scale)
**Key Services**: [3-4 services you'd use]

---

### Option 2: [GCP / Azure / PaaS]

**Why for you**: [Specific reason]
**Monthly Cost**: ~$[X]
**Key Services**: [3-4 services you'd use]

---

**My Recommendation**: [Provider] because [reason tied to your constraints].

**Question**: Which cloud provider do you prefer?"

**Wait for user answer before proceeding.**

---

### Question 3: Framework Category (CONDITIONAL)

**Question depends on architecture answer**:

**If SSG architecture chosen** → Ask about static site generators
**If SSR/Monolithic chosen** → Ask about full-stack frameworks
**If Serverless chosen** → Ask about serverless framework preferences

**Apply Smart Filtering** (example for SSG):

- If "performance critical" → Show Astro + Hugo (skip heavier options)
- If "familiar with React" → Show Next.js + Astro
- If "beginner" → Show Hugo + 11ty (skip React-based)
- **Always limit to 2-3 options**

**Example for SSG Architecture**:

"For static site generation with [your requirements], here are the best frameworks:

---

### Option 1: Astro

**Pros**:

- ✅ Excellent performance (zero JS by default)
- ✅ Component flexibility (can use React/Vue/Svelte)
- ✅ Perfect for blogs and content sites

**Cons**:

- ❌ Newer ecosystem (fewer themes than Hugo)

**Best for**: Modern blogs, performance-first
**Learning curve**: Medium
**Matches your**: [Performance requirements, modern tooling preference]

---

### Option 2: Hugo

**Pros**:

- ✅ Extremely fast builds (fastest static generator)
- ✅ Simple setup (single binary, no dependencies)
- ✅ Great for blogs (built-in features)

**Cons**:

- ❌ Go templating (less familiar than JavaScript)

**Best for**: Simple, fast blogs with minimal maintenance
**Learning curve**: Easy-Medium
**Matches your**: [Simplicity preference, performance needs]

---

**My Recommendation**: [Framework] because [specific reason].

**Question**: Which framework appeals to you?"

**Wait for user answer.**

---

## Step 3: Generate Questionnaire File

After 2-3 critical questions answered, generate `TECH_REQ_QUESTIONS.md` for remaining decisions.

**Inform User**:
"Great! Based on your choices:

- Architecture: [Choice]
- Cloud: [Choice]
- Framework: [Choice]

I'll now generate a questionnaire for the remaining technical decisions. You can answer these at your own pace.

**Generating**: `TECH_REQ_QUESTIONS.md`..."

## Smart Filtering Rules Reference

### Budget-Based Filtering

- **< $10/month**: Show managed/PaaS options, skip enterprise services
- **$10-50/month**: Show PaaS + basic cloud setups
- **> $50/month**: Show all options including complex architectures

### Scale-Based Filtering

- **< 1k users**: Skip microservices, show monolithic/serverless/SSG
- **1k-10k users**: Show most architectures except microservices
- **> 10k users**: Show all including microservices

### Complexity-Based Filtering

- **Beginner**: Show managed services, simple frameworks, PaaS
- **Intermediate**: Show most options
- **Advanced**: Show all including custom infrastructure

### Use Case-Based Filtering

- **Blog/Documentation**: Show only SSG + JAMstack
- **Internal Tool (< 10 users)**: Show monolithic + serverless
- **SaaS Application**: Show SSR + Microservices + Hybrid
- **E-commerce**: Show SSR + Hybrid (need dynamic + static)

---

## Example Filtered Question

**Bad** (Information Overload):

```
Here are 5 architecture options: Monolithic (pros: A, B, C, cons: D, E, F),
Microservices (pros: G, H, I, cons: J, K, L), Serverless (pros: M, N, O, cons: P, Q, R),
JAMstack (pros: S, T, U, cons: V, W, X), Hybrid (pros: Y, Z, AA, cons: BB, CC, DD)...
```

👎 User has to process 15 pros + 15 cons = 30 points before answering

**Good** (Smart Filtered):

```
Based on your single-author blog with < 1k users, here are the 2 best options:

Option 1: Static Site Generator
✅ Maximum performance, ✅ Minimal cost ($2-5/month), ✅ Perfect for blogs
❌ No dynamic features

Option 2: JAMstack
✅ Static performance + some dynamic features, ✅ Cost-effective
❌ More complex than pure SSG

Recommendation: SSG - matches your use case perfectly.
Which appeals to you?
```

👍 User processes 4 pros + 2 cons = 6 points, makes decision quickly
