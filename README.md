## Quick Start

This guidance integrates Claude Code with your existing OIDC identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, Auth0, or Cognito User Pools) to provide federated access to Amazon Bedrock.

### What You Need

**Existing Identity Provider:**
You must have an active OIDC provider with the ability to create application registrations. The guidance federates this IdP with AWS IAM to issue temporary credentials for Bedrock access.

**AWS Environment:**

- AWS account with IAM and CloudFormation permissions
- Amazon Bedrock activated in target regions
- Python 3.10+ development environment for deployment

### What Gets Deployed

The deployment creates:

- IAM OIDC Provider or Cognito Identity Pool for federation
- IAM roles with scoped Bedrock access policies
- Platform-specific installation packages (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Optional: OpenTelemetry monitoring infrastructure

**Deployment time:** 2-3 hours for initial setup including IdP configuration.

See [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) for complete step-by-step deployment instructions.

## Architecture Overview

This guidance uses Direct IAM OIDC federation as the recommended authentication pattern. This provides temporary AWS credentials with complete user attribution for audit trails and usage monitoring.

**Alternative:** Cognito Identity Pool is also supported for legacy IdP integrations. See [Deployment Guide](assets/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for comparison.

### Authentication Flow (Direct IAM Federation)

![Architecture Diagram](assets/images/credential-flow-direct-diagram.png)

1. **User initiates authentication**: User requests access to Amazon Bedrock through Claude Code
2. **OIDC authentication**: User authenticates with their OIDC provider and receives an ID token
3. **Token submission to IAM**: Application sends the OIDC ID token to Amazon Cognito
4. **IAM returns credentials**: AWS IAM validates and returns temporary AWS credentials
5. **Access Amazon Bedrock**: Application uses the temporary credentials to call Amazon Bedrock
6. **Bedrock response**: Amazon Bedrock processes the request and returns the response

## Prerequisites

### For Deployment (IT Administrators)

**Software Requirements:**

- Python 3.10-3.13
- Poetry (dependency management)
- AWS CLI v2
- Git

**AWS Requirements:**

- AWS account with appropriate IAM permissions to create:
  - CloudFormation stacks
  - IAM OIDC Providers or Cognito Identity Pools
  - IAM roles and policies
  - (Optional) Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) tasks and Amazon CloudWatch dashboards
  - (Optional) Amazon Athena, AWS Glue, AWS Lambda, and Amazon Data Firehose resources
  - (Optional) AWS CodeBuild
- Amazon Bedrock activated in target regions

**OIDC Provider Requirements:**

- Existing OIDC identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, Auth0, etc.)
- Ability to create OIDC applications
- Redirect URI support for `http://localhost:8400/callback`

### For End Users

**Software Requirements:**

- AWS CLI v2 (for credential process integration)
- Claude Code installed
- Web browser for SSO authentication

**No AWS account required** - users authenticate through your organization's identity provider and receive temporary credentials automatically.

**No Python, Poetry, or Git required** - users receive pre-built installation packages from IT administrators.

### Supported AWS Regions

The guidance can be deployed in any AWS region that supports:

- IAM OIDC Providers or Amazon Cognito Identity Pools
- Amazon Bedrock
- (Optional) Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) tasks and Amazon CloudWatch dashboards
- (Optional) Amazon Athena, AWS Glue, AWS Lambda, and Amazon Data Firehose resources
- (Optional) AWS CodeBuild

Both AWS Commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) partitions are supported. See [AWS Partition Support](#aws-partition-support) for details.

### Cross-Region Inference

Claude Code uses Amazon Bedrock's cross-region inference for optimal performance and availability. During setup, you can:

- Select your preferred Claude model (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
- Choose a cross-region profile (US, Europe, APAC) for optimal regional routing
- Select a specific source region within your profile for model inference

This automatically routes requests across multiple AWS regions to ensure the best response times and highest availability. Modern Claude models (3.7+) require cross-region inference for access.

### Platform Support

The authentication tools support all major platforms:

| Platform | Architecture          | Build Method                | Installation |
| -------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------ |
| Windows  | x64                   | AWS CodeBuild (Nuitka)      | install.bat  |
| macOS    | ARM64 (Apple Silicon) | Native (PyInstaller)        | install.sh   |
| macOS    | Intel (x86_64)        | Cross-compile (PyInstaller) | install.sh   |
| macOS    | Universal (both)      | Universal2 (PyInstaller)    | install.sh   |
| Linux    | x86_64                | Docker (PyInstaller)        | install.sh   |
| Linux    | ARM64                 | Docker (PyInstaller)        | install.sh   |

**Build System:**

The package builder automatically creates executables for all platforms using PyInstaller (macOS/Linux) and AWS CodeBuild with Nuitka (Windows). All builds create standalone executables - no Python installation required for end users.

See [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md#platform-builds) for detailed build configuration.

## AWS Partition Support

This guidance supports deployment across multiple AWS partitions with a single, unified codebase. The same CloudFormation templates and deployment process work seamlessly in both AWS Commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) regions.

### Supported Partitions

| Partition | Regions | Use Cases |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **AWS Commercial** (`aws`) | All regions where Bedrock is available | Standard commercial workloads |
| **AWS GovCloud (US)** (`aws-us-gov`) | us-gov-west-1, us-gov-east-1 | US government agencies, contractors, and regulated workloads |

### How It Works

The guidance automatically detects the AWS partition at deployment time and configures resources appropriately:

**Resource ARNs:**
- CloudFormation uses the `${AWS::Partition}` pseudo-parameter
- Automatically resolves to `aws` or `aws-us-gov`
- Example: `arn:${AWS::Partition}:bedrock:*::foundation-model/*`

**Service Principals:**
- Cognito Identity service principals are partition-specific
- Commercial: `cognito-identity.amazonaws.com`
- GovCloud West: `cognito-identity-us-gov.amazonaws.com`
- GovCloud East: `cognito-identity.us-gov-east-1.amazonaws.com`
- IAM role trust policies automatically use the correct principal based on region

**S3 Endpoints:**
- Commercial: `s3.region.amazonaws.com`
- GovCloud: `s3.region.amazonaws.com`

### Deploying to AWS GovCloud

Follow the same [Quick Start](#quick-start) instructions with your GovCloud credentials active. During `ccwb init`, select a GovCloud region (us-gov-west-1 or us-gov-east-1) and the wizard will automatically configure GovCloud-compatible models and endpoints.

**GovCloud-Specific Considerations:**

1. **Credentials:** GovCloud requires separate AWS credentials from commercial accounts
2. **Model IDs:** GovCloud uses region-prefixed model IDs (e.g., `us-gov.anthropic.*`)
3. **FIPS Endpoints:** Cognito hosted UI uses `{prefix}.auth-fips.{region}.amazoncognito.com`
4. **Managed Login:** Branding must be created for each Cognito app client

### Validation

After deployment, verify the correct partition configuration:

```bash
# Check IAM role ARN uses correct partition
aws iam get-role \
  --role-name BedrockCognitoFederatedRole \
  --region <region> \
  --query 'Role.Arn'

# Expected ARN formats:
# Commercial: arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:role/BedrockCognitoFederatedRole
# GovCloud: arn:aws-us-gov:iam::ACCOUNT:role/BedrockCognitoFederatedRole
```

### Backward Compatibility

✅ **All changes are fully backward compatible**

- Existing commercial deployments continue to work without modification
- CloudFormation updates can be applied to existing stacks
- No changes to user-facing functionality
- No data migration required

## What Gets Deployed

### Authentication Infrastructure

The `ccwb deploy` command creates:

**IAM Resources:**

- IAM OIDC Provider (for Direct IAM federation) or Cognito Identity Pool (for legacy IdP)
- IAM role with trust relationship for federated access
- IAM policies scoped to:
  - Bedrock model invocation in configured regions
  - CloudWatch metric publishing (if monitoring enabled)

**User Distribution Packages:**

- Platform-specific executables (Windows, macOS ARM64/Intel, Linux x64/ARM64)
- Installation scripts that configure AWS CLI credential process
- Pre-configured settings (OIDC provider, model selection, monitoring endpoints)

### Distribution Options (Optional)

After building packages, you can share them with users in three ways:

| Method                | Best For               | Authentication                 |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Manual Sharing**    | Any size team          | None                           |
| **Presigned S3 URLs** | Automated distribution | None                           |
| **Landing Page**      | Self-service portal    | IdP (Okta/Azure/Auth0/Cognito) |

**Manual Sharing:** Zip the `dist/` folder and share via email or internal file sharing. No additional infrastructure required.

**Presigned URLs:** Generate time-limited S3 URLs for direct downloads. Automated but requires S3 bucket setup.

**Landing Page:** Self-service portal with IdP authentication, platform detection, and custom domain support. Full automation with compliance features.

See [Distribution Comparison](assets/docs/distribution/comparison.md) for detailed setup guides.

### Admin Console (Optional)

A web-based admin console for managing users and quotas in real time. Follows the same ALB + OIDC + Lambda architecture as the landing page.

**Capabilities:**

- View all active users with current month token usage and quota status
- Filter users by email
- Create new user quota policies
- Edit quota limits (monthly/daily) and enforcement mode
- Block users instantly (sets quota to 0, immediately disables inference profiles)
- Delete users (removes policy and cleans up inference profiles)
- Dashboard stats: total users, active this month, over quota, blocked

**Architecture:** ALB with OIDC authentication → Lambda (Python 3.12) → DynamoDB (QuotaPolicies + UserQuotaMetrics) + Bedrock API (inference profile tagging). The Lambda serves both the SPA HTML and the REST API (`/api/users/*`).

**Setup:**

```bash
# Enable during initial setup
poetry run ccwb init    # answer "Yes" to "Enable admin console?"

# Or deploy standalone
poetry run ccwb deploy admin-console
```

The ALB can be deployed as internet-facing or internal (private VPC only). A custom domain with HTTPS is required for OIDC authentication. Supports all four IdP providers (Okta, Azure AD, Auth0, Cognito).

### Monitoring Infrastructure (Optional)

Enable usage visibility with OpenTelemetry monitoring stack:

**Components:**

- VPC and networking resources (or use existing VPC)
- ECS Fargate cluster running OpenTelemetry collector
- Application Load Balancer for metric ingestion
- CloudWatch dashboards with real-time usage metrics
- DynamoDB for metrics aggregation

**Optional Analytics Add-On:**

- Kinesis Data Firehose streaming metrics to S3
- S3 data lake for long-term storage
- Amazon Athena for SQL queries on historical data
- AWS Glue Data Catalog for schema management

See [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) for step-by-step deployment instructions.

## Monitoring and Operations

Three monitoring configurations are supported:

| Configuration | Token Metrics | Session/Activity Metrics | Infrastructure Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OTEL only** | OTEL → CloudWatch EMF | OTEL → CloudWatch EMF | ECS Fargate + VPC |
| **Inference Profiles only** | Bedrock CloudWatch (server-side) | — | None (no VPC) |
| **Both (recommended)** | Bedrock CloudWatch (server-side) | OTEL → CloudWatch EMF | ECS Fargate + VPC |

When both are enabled, the OTEL collector filters out token metrics to avoid double-counting.

### Available Metrics

**Token Economics:**

- Input/output/cache token consumption by user, model, and type
- Prompt caching effectiveness (hit rates, token savings)
- Cost attribution by user, team, or department

**Code Activity:**

- Lines of code written vs accepted (productivity signal)
- File operations breakdown (edits, searches, reads)
- Programming language distribution

**Operational Health:**

- Active users and top consumers
- Usage patterns (hourly/daily heatmaps)
- Authentication and API error rates

### Infrastructure

The monitoring stack (deployed with `ccwb deploy monitoring`) includes:

- ECS Fargate running OpenTelemetry collector
- Application Load Balancer for metric ingestion
- CloudWatch dashboards for real-time visualization
- Optional: S3 data lake + Athena for historical analysis

See [Monitoring Guide](assets/docs/MONITORING.md) for setup details and dashboard examples.
See [Analytics Guide](assets/docs/ANALYTICS.md) for SQL queries on historical data.

## Per-User CloudWatch Monitoring with Application Inference Profiles

This deployment supports an alternative monitoring approach based on **Bedrock Application Inference Profiles** that provides server-side usage tracking with zero client-side configuration. Unlike the OpenTelemetry stack, metrics are generated directly by AWS Bedrock and are always available regardless of how the end user has configured their environment.

### Why Use This Approach

The OpenTelemetry monitoring stack collects metrics from the client side. If a user's machine does not send data (misconfiguration, network issue, outdated binary), their token consumption is invisible to cost managers — but the AWS bill is not. Application Inference Profiles solve this:

- **Metrics are written server-side by Bedrock** — no client configuration required
- **Four native CloudWatch metrics** per invocation: `InputTokenCount`, `OutputTokenCount`, `CacheReadInputTokenCount`, `CacheWriteInputTokenCount`
- **Full cost attribution** by user, cost center, department, and organization via resource tags
- **Hourly (and finer) cost controls** — metrics are available at 1-minute granularity
- **Per-user isolation** — each user can only invoke their own profiles (ABAC enforcement)

### How It Works

On each user's **first login**, the credential provider automatically:

1. Creates one Bedrock Application Inference Profile per enabled model, named `claude-code-{email-hash}-{model-key}`
2. Tags each profile with `user.email`, `cost_center`, `department`, `organization` (from the OIDC JWT claims)
3. Patches `~/.claude.json` with the ARN of the default model so Claude Code uses it immediately

From that point, every Claude Code invocation is tracked in CloudWatch under the `Bedrock` namespace with the user's tags, with no further setup needed.

### Default Models

Three models are pre-configured. To add or retire a model, update `INFERENCE_PROFILE_MODELS` in [source/claude_code_with_bedrock/models.py](source/claude_code_with_bedrock/models.py):

| Model Key | Model | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `sonnet-4-6` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | **Default** — recommended for most workloads |
| `opus-4-6` | Claude Opus 4.6 | Most capable — complex reasoning |
| `haiku-4-5` | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Fastest and most cost-effective |

### Prerequisites

Before enabling this feature, ensure your deployment satisfies these requirements:

1. **Bedrock Application Inference Profiles quota** — the default limit is 2000 per account per region. With 3 models, this supports up to ~666 users before hitting the limit. Request an increase via [AWS Service Quotas](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/) (`Amazon Bedrock > Application inference profiles per account`) if needed.

2. **OIDC JWT must include an `email` claim** — this is standard for Okta, Azure AD (Microsoft Entra), Auth0, and Cognito User Pools. Verify your OIDC application is configured to include it.

3. **Optional cost attribution claims** — the following custom claims are mapped to CloudWatch tags automatically if present in the JWT:

   | JWT Claim | CloudWatch Tag |
   |---|---|
   | `custom:cost_center` | `cost_center` |
   | `custom:department` | `department` |
   | `custom:organization` | `organization` |
   | `custom:team` | `team` |

### Deployment Steps

**Step 1 — Enable the feature in your ccwb profile**

Edit your profile configuration (`~/.ccwb/profiles/<profile-name>.json`) and set:

```json
{
  "inference_profiles_enabled": true,
  "inference_profiles_default_model": "sonnet-4-6"
}
```

Or set it during `ccwb init` when prompted.

**Step 2 — Re-deploy the Cognito Identity Pool stack**

The IAM policy on the Cognito authenticated role must be updated to grant users permission to create and invoke their own Application Inference Profiles:

```bash
poetry run ccwb deploy auth --profile <your-profile>
```

This updates the `cognito-identity-pool.yaml` stack with the new ABAC IAM statements. The update is non-destructive and takes approximately 2 minutes.

**Step 3 — Re-package and redistribute (if using distribution)**

If you use the landing page or presigned S3 distribution, rebuild and redistribute the package so end users receive the updated credential provider binary:

```bash
poetry run ccwb package --profile <your-profile>
# then: ccwb distribute ...
```

**Step 4 — Verify on first user login**

After the first login, check that profiles were created:

```bash
# As the end user:
ccwb profiles list
```

Expected output:

```
Your Bedrock Application Inference Profiles

  Model Key    Display Name          ARN                                                                      Default
  opus-4-6     Claude Opus 4.6       arn:aws:bedrock:eu-central-1:123456789:application-inference-profile/…
  sonnet-4-6   Claude Sonnet 4.6     arn:aws:bedrock:eu-central-1:123456789:application-inference-profile/…   ●
  haiku-4-5    Claude Haiku 4.5      arn:aws:bedrock:eu-central-1:123456789:application-inference-profile/…

Default model in ~/.claude.json: arn:aws:bedrock:eu-central-1:123456789:application-inference-profile/…
```

### Changing the Default Model

Users can switch their active model at any time without re-authenticating:

```bash
ccwb profiles set-default opus-4-6
```

This updates `~/.claude.json` immediately. The change takes effect on the next Claude Code command.

### CloudWatch Cost Monitoring

Once profiles are active, navigate to **CloudWatch → Metrics → Bedrock** in the AWS Console. Filter by the tag `user.email` to see per-user consumption broken down into all four token types.

To set up a cost alarm for a specific user or cost center:

```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
  --alarm-name "bedrock-cost-alert-user" \
  --metric-name InputTokenCount \
  --namespace Bedrock \
  --dimensions Name=user.email,Value=user@example.com \
  --statistic Sum \
  --period 3600 \
  --threshold 1000000 \
  --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold \
  --evaluation-periods 1 \
  --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:<region>:<account>:<topic>
```

### Adding a New Claude Model

When Anthropic releases a new model, add it to `INFERENCE_PROFILE_MODELS` in [source/claude_code_with_bedrock/models.py](source/claude_code_with_bedrock/models.py):

```python
INFERENCE_PROFILE_MODELS = {
    # ... existing models ...
    "new-model-key": {
        "source_model_arn": "arn:aws:bedrock:{region}::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-new-model-v1:0",
        "display_name": "Claude New Model",
        "description": "Description of the new model",
        "enabled": True,
    },
}
```

Re-deploy and re-package. On their next login, each user will automatically get a new Application Inference Profile for the new model.

To retire a model without deleting existing profiles, set `"enabled": False`. The model will no longer be created for new users and will be excluded from `ccwb profiles list`.

### Compatibility with the OpenTelemetry Stack

The two monitoring approaches can coexist. When both are enabled:

- **Token metrics** (input/output/cache tokens, cost) come from Bedrock CloudWatch natively via inference profiles — server-side, cannot be bypassed
- **Session/activity metrics** (active time, code edits, tool usage, language distribution) flow through the OTEL collector
- The OTEL collector automatically filters out `claude_code.token.usage` and `claude_code.cost.usage` via a `filter/token_metrics` processor to avoid double-counting

Enable both during `ccwb init` by answering "Yes" to both "Enable Application Inference Profiles?" and "Deploy OpenTelemetry collector for session/activity metrics?".

To run inference profiles only (no OTEL infrastructure), answer "No" to the OTEL question. Token metrics will still be available in CloudWatch.

To decommission the OTEL stack later:

```bash
poetry run ccwb destroy monitoring --profile <your-profile>
```

### Server-Side Quota Enforcement

When inference profiles are enabled, quota enforcement is fully server-side using IAM tag conditions:

- Each inference profile carries a `status` tag (`enabled` / `disabled`)
- IAM policy requires `aws:ResourceTag/status = enabled` on every `InvokeModel` call
- `ClaudeCode-QuotaEnforcer` Lambda runs every 5 minutes: reads usage from DynamoDB, compares against quota policies, and tags profiles `disabled` when limits are exceeded
- Once disabled, every subsequent Bedrock call returns `AccessDeniedException` immediately — no client-side bypass possible
- Worst-case enforcement lag: ~17 minutes after quota exceeded

Related Lambdas (fixed names, not stack-dependent):
- `ClaudeCode-QuotaCheck` — real-time quota check for credential issuance
- `ClaudeCode-QuotaEnforcer` — tags profiles enabled/disabled based on usage
- `ClaudeCode-QuotaMonitor` — monitors usage and sends SNS alerts
- `ClaudeCode-InferenceProfileProvisioner` — creates per-user inference profiles on first login

### Session Tags & ABAC Configuration

ABAC requires `UserEmail`, `UserId`, and `UserName` principal tags on every STS session. Configuration depends on the federation path:

**Auth0 (Direct Federation)** — requires a Post-Login Action:
```javascript
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  if (event.user.email) {
    const sanitizedUserId = event.user.user_id
      .replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9 _.:/=+\-@]/g, '-');
    api.idToken.setCustomClaim('https://aws.amazon.com/tags', {
      principal_tags: {
        UserEmail: [event.user.email],
        UserId: [sanitizedUserId],
        UserName: [event.user.name || event.user.email]
      },
      transitive_tag_keys: ['UserEmail', 'UserId', 'UserName']
    });
  }
};
```

**Okta (Direct Federation)** — requires a Token Inline Hook with the same claim structure, or use Cognito Identity Pool fallback.

**Azure AD / Cognito User Pool** — use Cognito Identity Pool. Tags are mapped automatically via `PrincipalTagMapping` in the CFN template (no IdP-side configuration needed).
